# DogSelector

Do you want a dog but you have no idea which dog to choose? 

This program runs an algorithm similar to a decision tree to help you choose the perfect dog breed to get!
It incoporates important factors in deciding a dog such as weight, cost, size, home size, allergies, and so many more.
